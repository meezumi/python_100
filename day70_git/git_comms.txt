git add . to commit all the changes and files to staging 

git commit -m "enter your message here of what you are commiting"

git <filename> diff - to check the current value that the file holds, to the value it did when last commit took place.

to link up a local repo to a remote repo on github, we use the command - 

git remote add origin <link of the remote repository here>

git push origin main -u

to clone a repository, we use 

git clone <http address of the remote repo you wan to clone>

for example we using: https://github.com/inolen/quakejs

git clone https://github.com/inolen/quakejs.git 

BRANCHING AND MERGING //////////////////

git branch <branch_name>

to check the number of branches in the repo:

git branch 

to which to another branch we use:

git checkout <branch_name>

(you have to be on the main branch to merge)

git merge <branch_name>
