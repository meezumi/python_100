1. [nano name_of_script.sh]

2. # the first line should be:
        [!#/bin/bash]
# specify the code here of the program or cd into the directory where it is present.
        ctrl+x then y to save the changes there.

3. in terminal now, to make it executable we use:
        [chmod +x name_of_script.sh]

        [./name_of_script.sh]
